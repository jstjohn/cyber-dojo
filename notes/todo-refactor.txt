Dojo.rb Katas.rb Kata.rb
These are poorly named. Should have been
Dojo.rb -> CyberDojo.rb
Katas.rb -> Dojos.rb
Kata.rb -> Dojo.rb
Also Exercses.rb -> Katas.rb
  and Exercise.rb -> Kata.rb
and cyber-dojo/katas/  -> cyber-dojo/dojos
Is the latter too big a change to make?

Can't run the tests on the Macbook pro (but can run a rails server).
Write a script to edit the rights of the cyber-dojo folder
(chown/chmod/sefacl). Run this from pull.sh?
I think this is also causing one of the steps when setting
up a digital-ocean server to appear to fail.
Might be worth trying to automate adding the current user
to the www-data group.

line 30 of pull.sh should name the admin_scripts folder
so it has chown -R run on it.

I think its quite likely I'll have two C++ compilers at
some point - one for g++ and one for clang. 
I can name the folders whatever I like, since the display_name
is what actually appears on the setup page. So have 
/gpp/  and  /clang/  folders
and perhaps also have display names as
  C++ (g++)

While building support for C-CppUTest

I often find I fork from someone's traffic-light and then
immediately enter it to demonstrate something. Could I
provide two buttons on the history dialog
- one to fork a dojo
- one to fork a dojo and start an animal?
Or maybe when you click the fork button it opens a new dialog
with two buttons offering the two choices above.

If I decided to make dojo ids more than 10 chars long
I could end up with 2nd level katas dirs some of which were
8 chars long and some of which were 9+ chars long.
Would the current design cope with that?
I think katas.complete(id) would be ok
but katas.create_kata() calls katas.valid?(id)
which has id.length == 10

Suppose I clone the server and switch over to it.
Since the clone is not instant, I cannot avoid the
possibility of a browser not switching cleanly to the
new server after it made updates on the old server, which
were not copied to the clone. This suggests a model where
existing katas/ continue to use the server they start
on but new katas/ are forwarded to a new server. Yes.
This sounds right. And feels right. Ok. How to proceed?
Can I divert creation of new katas to a
second server? Then, as long as katas have a timeout, I will
know that after a certain time, all katas on the old server
can be copied to the new server. At that point I can divert
all incoming requests to the new server.
There needs to be a proxy server sitting at the front.
It can ask both servers whether they contain a kata
with a given ID. Or maybe it could simply try the new
server first, and if that fails it could drop back
to the old server. This means old katas are slowed
down rather than new katas are slowed down.
But slowing down from a read-only response must
be a better option. This 'universal' proxy server would
also be useful for backups and sharding. Investigate.

Would be useful to have a script to

If there is an update such as DockerTestRunner.rb switching to

Think about switching from AWS to Digital Ocean (DO). Much cheaper.
Issues... cant stop-start a server. Would I need a second test-bed
server and would it have to be up all the time? How would I transfer
all the dojos from AWS to DO? Answer is via a recent clone.
Also backups? How do you do a backup on DO? It seems you have
to stop the server to do a snapshot. Of course if I am sharding
and all shards have all the data then I have natural backups...

Use Amazon console to switch cyber-dojo.org so it uses an
SSD drive. Nick Todd knows how to do this and is happy to help.
How to do this so it's down for minimal time?
First learn how to do it by doing it on a clone.
Will need to redirect the IP address... Bringing it down for a
short period of time would mean no dojos get lost during the
transition. Nick mentioned an elastic? IP address which allows
the same IP address to be set from the Amazon console, but for
the server underneath it to be switched.

does refactoring_dojos.tgz still have katas in old manifest.rb format?
Check this on cyber-dojo.org for eg
cyberdojo/katas/76/DD58DE08
which is the refactoring kata for Yahtzee,C++
Recreate the .tgz file on cyber-dojo.org
using cyberdojo/admin_scripts/save_refactoring_dojos.rb
Then scp the .tgz file to my local computer.
Then make sure that the .tgz file is part of the git repo
and commit it and push it.
. . . .
save_refactoring_dojos.rb is unable to find
435E5C1C88 (tennis,python,unittest)
It turns out this was one of the few katas that were not
converted from rb to json. So it's currently in the
katas_rb_bad/ folder on cyber-dojo.org
I have tarred it into its own .tgz file (on cyber-dojo.org)
tennis_python_refactoring_kata.tgz
When I have a better internet connection (in China) I will
recreate the kata from the 435E5C1C88/moose (tag 5) git repo.

having all the output-parse functions in the same module

   Approval.remove_deleted_txt_files(sandbox.path, visible_files)

deleted files. These default to nothing - to do nothing.
This could be combined with steps in cyber-dojo.sh to do some
quite powerful things, eg creation of coverage stats which are
then loaded. It creates the possibility of some of these being html
which is loaded and displayed in a textarea replacement.

make diff-dialog a plain page (non-dialog)?
This will enable small dialogs for fork failures.
Issue with this is that it means I cannot (easily)
collapse the revert/fork into the diff-page. So I will
need to keep the revert button on the edit-page.
And only fork will go onto the diff-review page.
A benefit of making diff-review a page is that it will
have more space to display a trail of traffic-lights and
possibly mark on the trail which lights correspond
to the was-tag and now-tag.
What about traffic-lights on the edit/test page?
Do they open a diff-dialog? Perhaps not. Why not have
just the lights on the dashboard page open a new diff page.

in controllers I do params['id']
If id is not present in params this will be nil
If params['id']==nil is used as part of a string path
the + concatenation will fail.
Eg forker_controller
    kata = dojo.katas[params['id']]
    if !error && !kata.exists?
This will create an Id.new(nil)
which means both
  Id.new(nil).inner
  Id.new(nil).outer
will cause an exception.
Similarly
   a = avatars[params['avatar']]
   a.path
will cause an exception since in
    kata.path + name + '/'
name will be nil.
Note the need to check name isn't "" since that dir would
exist - it would be the kata's dir.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
forker-controller could go straight to the tag existence check
and bypass the kata and avatar check. Would simplify things.
Perhaps do that in a block and in the rescue clause try
to determine a finer-grained error message.
Needs a tags.exists?(tag) function
Or tags[tag].exists? to match current style.
This will need Tag to get the max tag for the avatar.

Move clean(string) code into Dir.read ?

  $ git shortlog
  lists all the commit tags. So
  irb: `cd dir;git shortlog -s`.to_i
  gets you last current git tag
  And then
     avatar.tags[-1]

  So if there is no [event:==key] then take it to be a test event.
  Otherwise the event is named eg :rename
   colour: for a :rename could be 'previous-red'
  This gives an easy way to create the list of traffic-lights
  by simply filtering all the entries.

        # This will also remove the dependency on content here.

  Or is it feasible that the duration could become a parameter
  in a language manifest for example?
  What about tests? Is it simpler to substitute a different
  max-duration as a parameter? I think so.

    handy shortcut for this could be

  There should be a dependency on the language manifest file
  only for startup. Once started a kata should have a *copy* of
  the manifest. Eg, I edit the manifest's highlight_filenames settings
  it should affects only those katas started after the edit.

Pressing the test button in the browser sometimes creates a new
traffic-light but the output you get back gets stuck and does
not reflect edits made to the files. A work-around when this happens
is to reopen the URL in a new tab.

On my Mac (10.7.4) using Firefox (18.0.1) using a local server
(http://localhost:3000) when you load a file and move the cursor
position using the mouse-pad then the texarea becomes readonly
(and the mac beeps at me)????
Repeatable on the cyber-dojo live server in Firefox.
Doesn't happen on Chrome on my Mac.
Doesn't happen on Safari on my Mac.
Doesn't happen on Opera on my Mac.
Doesn't happen on Jakub's mac using Firefox.
Seems to be a problem local to me.

Edit help dialog needs to show fork icon. Or the word fork now that the
  overly subtle fork-icon has been dropped.
-----
The starting test file should explicitly say that the initial code
  is always the same for all exercises and just gives a very simple
  example of how to write a test. It should also explain that the red
  amber green status relies on the test format used so that should not
  be changed. Again be explicit. Eg in the C++ tests using assert it
  should say "the red-amber-green status determination relies on the
  output being the output from assert. So don't change that. Keep using
  assert.

Suppose I record the ip-address of each animal in a dojo and have a
  kata/edit heartbeat that maintains the ip-address timestamp.
  This will allow me to only offer animals to resume-from when those
  animals are not themselves already being used.
  However, this raises the possibility of the following scenario.
  o) laptop1 starts as hippo
  o) laptop1 suspends (eg folds laptop screen down)
  o) laptop2 resumes as hippo (its ip-address now the hippo's)
  o) laptop1 unsuspends, and its heartbeat now detects that
    it is no longer the hippo.
  So not sure I need this.
Hitting fork button brings up dialog box (which will ultimately have
  ability to move files between visible and hidden sections)
-----
in the diff view, long lines no longer get truncated but the scrolled
  into view portion has lost its red/green colouring.
  Also when scrolling, the line numbers
  are scrolled out of view. Ideally, the line numbers would remain
  in place like they do in the main edit-test page.

The Click-to-revert tip could appear when the current-traffic-light-count
  disappears (and disappear when it reappears). This would also mean
  you don't get the 'Click to revert' tip when there is only one
  traffic-light (which is kind of pointless).
-----
Now that the traffic-lights offer reverting, it makes sense to allow
  you to revert from any traffic-light. Yet only enough to fit on the
  top row are shown. Perhaps the top row can hold all the
  traffic-lights but is auto-scrolled to the far right after the tests
  have finished. And they could be scrollable, even though there is no
  scrollbar. Or maybe simply offer a < > navigation in the revert dialog.
-----
Offer the fork button on the main edit-test page?
-----
I'm not seeing horizontal or vertical scrollbars
  for long lines in Safari
-----
traffic-light tool tips need some tlc
  in particular reverted traffic-lights should mention the
  traffic-light number they themselves reverted to.
  And they don't need to mention 'traffic-lights' - you can
  see they are traffic lights. Maybe say something like
  'deer has hit test 34 times and is currently at green'
-----
the dashboard traps carriage-returns on the secs_per_columns and
  maximum_columns text fields and makes a post call. It could
  parse the text field to verify it is an integer first before
  posting (like the diff page does for the was_tag and now_tag
  text fields)
-----
allow initial manifest.rb setup of initial exercise/language to
  contain subfolders. Do I need this? Could it already be done
  with links?
-----
once a dojo has been created it should be independent of the
  initial language filesets it was created from.
  For example, you should be able to rename a languages sub-folder
  and a dojo created from it before the rename should be ok.
-----
diff-filename-click cycles to the next diff but it loses the
  current red/green toggling states
-----
in diff page when you go back to a file with diff it should not cycle to next
  diff change it should only cycle to next diff change if you click the filename
  when the filename is already selected.

In lib/CodeOutputParser.rb...
if a player creates a cyber-dojo.sh file which runs two or more
test files then it's possible that the output will contain the
strings denoting red and green traffic-lights. Because of this the
regex's should test for a red traffic-light first, and for
a green traffic-light second.
Also CodeOutputParser.rb with its function parse() should be
renamed based on what it does from the outside rather than
from the inside - namely it simply determines the traffic
light colour. Maybe something like
module TrafficLight
  def self.colour(unit_test_framework, output)
    ...
  end
end
-----
The intention with the installation tests is that they are used to determine
what languages are installed and to only offer those languages (at the create
page). But at the moment all the languages are being offered.
